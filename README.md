# App-Development
App created following along to an online event called 'End-to-End App Development Using Visual Studio Code'

Event Description: A tour of visual studio code before creating a simple web app with Node.js and Express*.
My app will be deployed to Azure App Service* and integrated with the built in source control feature before pushing to GitHub

*note- I am unfamilar with 'Express' and 'Azure App Service at this time, so I will be taking notes on it
